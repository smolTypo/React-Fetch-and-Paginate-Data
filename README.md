# React Fetch and Paginate Data

This is an exercise developed for Module 15 of MIT xPro Full Stack Bootcamp


The goal of this exercise is to use React to get data from the MIT Hacker News remote data source and add client-side pagination to display the data on multiple pages.

Here I have created a React component that will fetch the data from the remote data source and render the data on the page. I also implemented a pagination component to allow the user to navigate between different pages of data.
